# Audio Files

## "It's Alive!" Voice-Over

Place your "It's Alive!" audio file here with the name:
- `its-alive.mp3` (recommended)
- OR `its-alive.wav`
- OR `its-alive.ogg`

The audio will play automatically when the player completes a level and sees the "IT'S ALIVE!" text on screen.

## Supported Formats
- MP3 (best browser compatibility)
- WAV (uncompressed, larger file size)
- OGG (good compression, good compatibility)

## Tips
- Keep the file size reasonable (under 500KB recommended)
- Normalize the audio volume so it's not too loud or quiet
- The game will play it at -5dB volume (adjustable in AudioSystem.ts)
