Mad Scientist Code Style GuideThis Steering Document defines the mandatory technical stack and code conventions for the Frankenstein Handheld project.1. Project Technology and Dependencies (Tech Steering)All code generation MUST adhere to the following technological constraints:ComponentRequired TechnologyUsage NotesCore Renderingthree.jsThe sole 3D rendering engine.Logic & TypesTypeScriptMUST be used for all game logic and data typing.AnimationsTween.jsMUST be used for all 3D object and camera animations.LightingCustom Light TypesMay use custom lighting setups, including concepts from drei (e.g., dynamic shadows, custom environments) adapted for pure three.js.2. Naming Conventions (Code Steering)All identifiers MUST follow these rules to ensure consistency:RuleDescriptionExampleCore FunctionsAll top-level game loop, FSM state change, and ritual functions MUST use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.START_RITUAL_SEQUENCE, HANDLE_BUTTON_PRESSFSM StatesAll Finite State Machine (FSM) states MUST be defined as TypeScript Enums and MUST use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.STATE_CALM, STATE_ANGRY, STATE_RITUAL_ACTIVEState VariablesAll variables or properties related to the monster's state, health, or madness level MUST be prefixed with golem_ (camelCase).golem_current_state, golem_madnessLevelLocal VariablesMUST use standard camelCase.raycasterHit, isAnimating3. Directory and Asset Structure (Structure Steering)All files MUST be placed in the following structured directories:PurposeMandatory Directory PathNotesCore Game Logicsrc/logic/TypeScript files for the Finite State Machine (FSM) and core game rules.3D Renderingsrc/render/TypeScript files for the three.js scene setup, controls, and visual effects.Project Constantssrc/config/Dedicated location for all unchangeable values (durations, limits, UI text, etc.).3D Assetsassets/models/All GLB/GLTF 3D model files MUST be placed here.
